The fourth and (hopefully) final revision of Darrius Modpack -- An SMP modpack with Create, Origins, and Terralith. This edition is designed with performance in mind, so many mods are been removed, maintaining a similar experience while boosting performance. This modpack is based on Simply Optimized, adding mods such as the Create mod (and a couple of add-ons), as well as Origins(++) and Terralith (and others). Included are other quality-of-life mods, including Simple Voice Chat, Jade, minimap, and JEI.

## Usage

To use this modpack as the client, follow Modrinth's instructions up there ⬆️⬆️⬆️. To use this modpack on a server, I would suggest making some adjustments as this modpack has quite a few client-side mods and lacks some server-type mods.
